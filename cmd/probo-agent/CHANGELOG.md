# Changelog

All notable changes to the `probo-agent` device posture agent will be
documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- macOS and Windows only: menu bar / system tray enrollment helper
  (`probo-agent tray`). After install, a native enrollment window opens
  automatically when the device is not yet enrolled (SwiftUI on macOS,
  WinForms on Windows); users pick a Probo region (US, EU, or Self
  hosted) and provide a device API key.
  Once enrolled the menu shows **Connected** with **About** and
  **Quit** only. Linux and FreeBSD keep the CLI-only
  `probo-agent install` flow.
- Native enrollment UI helpers (`probo-agent-enroll-ui`) for macOS and
  Windows, bundled with release archives and macOS `.pkg` installers.
- Browser deep-link enrollment flow (`probo://enroll?...`) with a hidden
  `probo-agent enroll-url` command that starts elevated enrollment install
  on macOS and Windows.
- Shared `regions.json` manifest for enrollment UI region labels and
  console URLs, validated against Go server URL constants.
- World-readable enrollment marker so the user-session tray helper
  can detect enrollment without reading the API key.

### Changed

- macOS `.pkg` installer no longer prompts for a device API key during
  installation. Enrollment is handled by the menu bar helper (MDM
  pre-staged `/tmp/probo-agent.conf` still works). Linux and FreeBSD
  installers are unchanged.
- Enrollment helper dialogs on macOS and Windows now open `/enroll` in
  the browser instead of collecting tokens locally.
- Windows release archives now include `register-protocol.ps1` to
  register the `probo://` URL protocol for the current user.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Initial release of the Probo device posture agent.
- `probo-agent install`, `uninstall`, `run`, `status`, `collect` CLI
  commands.
- Managed OS service installation for macOS (`launchd`), Linux
  (`systemd`), FreeBSD (`rc.d`), and Windows (Service Control Manager).
- v1 posture check set per OS: disk encryption, screen lock, firewall,
  time sync, OS version, auto update, password policy, remote login.
- Enrollment / heartbeat / posture reporting against the new
  `/api/agent/v1` Probo REST API.
- Auto-update: the agent periodically checks GitHub Releases for a
  newer `probo-agent/v*` tag and self-installs it. The running binary
  is swapped atomically and the OS service supervisor is asked to
  restart via a dedicated exit code (`75`).
- Cosign signature verification of every release before installation:
  `checksums.txt.bundle` is verified with `sigstore-go` against the
  Sigstore public-good trust root, pinned to the GitHub Actions OIDC
  identity for `release-probo-agent.yaml` on a tagged commit. Releases
  without a Sigstore bundle, with an invalid bundle, or signed by a
  different workflow are rejected without touching the running
  binary.
- `probo-agent update [--check]` command for manual one-shot upgrade.
- `probo-agent install --no-auto-update` flag to opt out of automatic
  upgrades; the flag is persisted in `config.json` as
  `updates_disabled`.
- `probo-agent status` now reports the configured update interval and
  whether auto-update is enabled.
- Screen lock detection for additional Linux desktop environments: KDE
  Plasma, i3, Sway, Hyprland, Xfce, MATE, Cinnamon, UKUI, and LightDM.

### Fixed

- macOS launchd service label corrected to `com.probo.agent`.
- FreeBSD check command failures are now handled before reading service
  status.
- macOS postinstall script no longer uses `eval` to parse configuration.
- Windows agent key file replacement is now performed atomically.
- Windows service uninstall is now idempotent.
- FreeBSD `rc.d` install validates executable and state directory paths
  to prevent shell injection.
